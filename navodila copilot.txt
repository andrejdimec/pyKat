Write me an arcpy python program that shares single arcgis pro layer "jasek_razno" as web layer to arcgis online portal. I don't want to share all layers in map, only one. Checks and confirm with print layer’s existence before proceeding. Use CreateWebLayerSDDraft and not getWebLayerSharingDraft
Name of the arcgis pro project is "dev_project.aprx". Path to the project is "d:\Kataster\GR_D96\Projects". Name of the arcgis pro map is "map1". Name of arcgis pro layer to be shared is "jasek_razno6". Use newest arcgis pro, arcpy and python versions. Do not use AnalyzeForSD. Login credentials for arcgis online: user: komunala_radgona, password: kora1234
layer name and filename of draft file should be from the same variable layer_name. For working folder use ArcGis scratchfolder function.
Delete staging temp files after uploading to portal
Print what program is doing. Write detailed comments of code
